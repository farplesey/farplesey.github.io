                    Turns out not even faeries get their fairytale ending.
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    17-year-old anti-magic activist Elia Diakon wants peace for Spokane. 
                    Humans and non-humans (faeries, trolls, goat people, whatever) are at each other's throats, 
                    and her dad's peaceful protests seem like the best way to keep everyone safe. 
                    But when a new student starts flirting with her in the halls, it's a little embarrassing how much she loves it. 
                    Gerrity Gross has hurricane hair, a wicked smile, and immunity to Elia's goblin-like social skills. 
                    Despite all odds, Elia goes on a real date…and it only kind of goes horribly wrong.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The next day, Gerrity vanishes. Elia tracks down his address, only to find it belongs to a half-lion girl with half-baked jokes. 
                    The two team up to get Gerrity back and enter a realm of elegant immortals and stone-toothed cannibals, where Elia is forced to confront how little she knows about her sort-of boyfriend.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As the trail goes cold, Elia gets word a murder-happy human group is planning to execute some magical creatures. 
                    Gerrity is likely one of the soon-to-be victims, but in a city where attacks are the norm, no one is coming to help. 
                    All those teenage experiences Elia was hoping to have become further out of reach as she puts her life on the line to save his. 
                    Even if he's not the charming boy she thought he was—and maybe doesn't deserve to be saved. 
                    As violence bleeds into her 'normal teenager' life, Elia must choose between being with the people who make her feel like she belongs and doing whatever it takes to keep them safe. 
                    Turns out not even faeries get their fairytale ending.
